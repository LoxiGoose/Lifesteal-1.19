This is a forge interpretation of the Lifesteal SMP. This mod was made as a learning experience for me to get better at Java and Forge, I will try to add features requested but no promises! Oh and also no, this isn't the same creator who made the Fabric version. 

THIS MOD IS STILL IN ALPHA, EXPECT BUGS! If you find one, please let us know by reporting it to our Issues Tracker!

 

Lifesteal

 

A mod where killing other players steals their hearts, dying will cause you to lose hearts too. This mod comes with a config that can be used for your needs making this mod not just like Lifesteal from the Lifesteal SMP but a tad bit more with few extra cool features :O.

 

This can be put on the server-side and players will be able to join without downloading the mod. This mod was not intended for single-player but can be used.

 

Important Info

At the moment, you won't get hearts if you kill another player from natural causes, for example if you set them on fire and they burn by death. This may change in the future depending on how much better I get at coding in Java and Forge.
Server-side only capability (Only the server needs to have the mod, clients can play without. You can also play singleplayer with this mod however gaining hearts will be impossible from this mod.)
No commands at the moment
Forge only, might port to Fabric in the future

Configuration to edit this mod for your needs :)
