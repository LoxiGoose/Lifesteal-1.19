This is a forge interpretation of the Lifesteal SMP. This mod was made as a learning experience for me to get better at Java and Forge, I will try to add features requested but no promises! Oh and also no, this isn't the same creator who made that Fabric Lifesteal mod.

 

THIS MOD IS STILL IN ALPHA, EXPECT BUGS! If you find one, please let us know by reporting it to our Issues Tracker!

 

A mod where killing other players steals their hearts, dying will cause you to lose hearts too.

 

This can be put on the server-side and players will be able to join without downloading the mod. This mod was not intended for single-player but can be used, the only missing feature will be that you can't get hearts. (Not until the config gets added anyway)

 

There's currently no config at the moment as this is a very early version of the mod but when there's one here is what you can expect from it.

- Maximum amount of hearts a player can gain

- Maximum amount of hearts that a player can lose, once they've the maximum, players killing them won't gain new hearts

- Ability to get banned when you lose all hearts (Incompatible with the top one)

- Should you lose hearts when killed at all or only by a player

- Killing any mobs will give you hearts

- How many hearts should be taken away when a player dies. (This also means that if a player killed them, they'll gain the amount of hearts you lost)

 

At the moment, you won't get hearts if you kill another player from natural causes, for example if you set them on fire and they burn by death. This may change in the future depending on how much better I get at coding in Java and Forge.
