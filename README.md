This is a forge interpretation of the Lifesteal SMP. This mod was made as a learning experience for me to get better at Java and Forge.

 

As of 2.0.0, this mod is required to be both on server-side and client-side. If you don't like this, you can play on 1.2.0 which completely removes ores allowing for only requiring server-side. 1.2.0 IS NOT SUPPORTED THOUGH, it will not receive bug fixes or updates.

A fabric port is in the works at the moment, you can visit the progress of the port here and view the ReadMe for what is done already. https://github.com/LoxiGoose/Lifesteal-Fabric

When it's done, the port will be bundled together with the Forge port in one Jar file on this page.
 

Lifesteal

A mod where killing other players steals their hearts, dying will cause you to lose hearts too. This mod comes with extra features that the original Lifesteal SMP doesn't have which you may not like and that's okay! All of these features are customizable in the config and can be disabled to your liking.

Important Info

At the moment, you won't get hearts if you kill another player from natural causes, for example if you set them on fire and they burn by death. This may change in the future depending on how much better I get at coding in Java and Forge.
Server-side only capability (1.2.0 ONLY! 2.0.0 adds in new ores and items that require the client to also have this mod. You are only missing 2 configuration options if you stay on this version.)
Forge only, might port to Fabric in the future
Basic Features

Gain hearts by killing another player

Ores and Recipes

Ores mainly spawn around y 0 but can be spotted from -80 to 80 y. All of these ores can be found in the Overworld, and the Nether. (ONLY VANILLA BIOMES, the ores don't spawn in modded biomes.)

Look at images for how they look. Recipes should and can be found using JEI, the ones in images are currently outdated and won't be changed till I am certain the current recipes will stay.

Config

 The config is located in the "config" folders in your MC directory or server folder and is named "lifesteal-common.toml".

Here's an example of the config: https://github.com/LoxiGoose/Lifesteal-1.19/blob/master/Configuration
