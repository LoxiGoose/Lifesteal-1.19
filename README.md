This is a forge interpretation of the Lifesteal SMP. This mod was made as a learning experience for me to get better at Java and Forge.

As of 2.0.0, this mod is required to be both on server-side and client-side. If you don't like this, you can play on 1.2.0 which completely removes ores allowing for only requiring server-side. (2 Configurations from the Config are not in this version however)

Lifesteal

 

A mod where killing other players steals their hearts, dying will cause you to lose hearts too. This mod comes with extra features that the original Lifesteal SMP doesn't have which you may not like and that's okay! All of these features are customizable in the config and can be disabled to your liking.

 

Important Info

- At the moment, you won't get hearts if you kill another player from natural causes, for example if you set them on fire and they burn by death. This may change in the future depending on how much better I get at coding in Java and Forge.
- Server-side only capability (1.2.0 ONLY! 2.0.0 adds in new ores and items that require the client to also have this mod. You are only missing 2 configuration options if you stay on this version.)
- Forge only, might port to Fabric in the future

Basic Features

- Lose hearts when you die at all
- Gain hearts by killing another player
- Upon losing all hearts, enter spectator mode
- Heart Crystals to increase your max health!
- Configuration to edit this mod for your needs :)
- Commands! (setHitPointDifference, getHitPointDifference, setLives, getLives)
 

Ores and Recipes

Ores mainly spawn around y 0 but can be spotted from -80 to 80 y. All of these ores can be found in the Overworld, Nether, and End.

Config

The config is located in the "config" folders in your MC directory or server folder and is named "lifesteal-common.toml".
